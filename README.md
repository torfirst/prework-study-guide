# Boot Camp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this webpage is to keep all my boot camp prework study notes in a single, easy to reference place. Building this webpage also served as a real life exercise for me, as I was able to apply every prework topic that I've learned so far to complete this project. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

There are four sections of notes to review for four topics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Opening the DevTools console will show the JavaScript running on the webpage. There are two scripts, one that lists the topics learned from prework, and one that will randomly choose a topic to study first. 

## Credits

I learned how to build most of this webpage from the boot camp prework instructions. I also used some of the knowledge that I learned on freeCodeCamp to create the gradient in the header/footer, as well as link an image in the CSS section.
