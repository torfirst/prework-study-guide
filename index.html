              <ul class="nested-ul">
                <li>For example: the character set used, keywords for SEO, a web page description, the author, viewport, and optionally, setting the document to refresh after a set period of time.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>CSS style information for that page only, if applicable.</li>
            <li>An external CSS style sheet, if there is one.</li>
            <li>The title of the page, which is displayed on the browser tab.</li>

          <li>git pull origin main: syncs the most current version of the main branch to your computer. It's always best practice to do this first before commiting to avoid any merge conflicts.</li>

          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop contains three important statements:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop.</li>
              <ul class="nested-ul">
                <li>For example, this can be declaring a variable, and giving it a value of the first value in an array.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>The second statement is the condition.</li>
              <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
            </ol>
          <li>Unlike "for" loops, functions do not automatically execute. Functions must be called after being defined. Functions can be called as many times as needed.</li>
